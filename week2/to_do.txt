I still need to verify the loops, since itâ€™s difficult to catch errors, especially with so many nested loops and when adjusting the code from paper to VSCode. 
I also forgot to add the bias as a 1D array, which affects the final result. There should be biases in both the hidden and output layers, so these must be added.
